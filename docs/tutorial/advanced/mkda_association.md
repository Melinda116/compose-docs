## The Problem

A key feature that sets aside the Neurosynth platform is large-scale â€œassociation" maps (which we previously called "reverse inference" maps).

In a neuroimaging meta-analysis, researchers pool a set of studies that invoke a common psychological construct or task to determine where brain activity is consistently activated. For example, in our [manual meta-analysis](../manual) tutorial, we identified 13 studies where subjects underwent nicotine administration. By combining the results of individual studies, we can see which brain regions consistently activate for this task.

Although this is a useful approach, there is a significant inferential challenge-- namely, determining how *specific* the relationship between activity in a given region and the cognitive state invoked by the target task. This is difficult, in part because brain regions vary widely in how specifically they activate for different tasks. Some brain regions, such as the insula or lateral prefrontal cortex, play a very broad role in cognition, and hence consistently activate for many different tasks and cognitive constructs. 

Thus, perhaps a more useful question is if and where brain activity occurs *more consistently* for studies investigating a task or construct (in our case, nicotine administration) than studies that *do not* elicit that task or construct. The Neurosynth dataset (or any other large-scale neuroimaging datasets) is a useful reference, as it consists of tens of thousands of diverse neuroimaging studies automatically sample from the literature.

## MKDA Chi-Squared

In our example we want to know if and where studies of nicotine administration show more consistent brain activation, than *all other studies* in the Neurosynth database (15,000+ studies). 

We can perform this test using the `Multilevel kernel density (MKDA) analysis - Chi-square` analysis, originally introduced in [Wager et al.,](https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsm015). For every voxel, we test if a greater proportion of studies in our meta-analysis activate a given voxel than in a large set of studies that *we did not select* for our inclusion criteria. 

Conceptually, this tests if there's evidence of a *population level* association between the task or psychological construct in our meta-analysis and brain activation (for every voxel). It is equivalent to conducting a chi-squared test of independence for a 2-by-2 table of counts for each voxel, where the binary variables are foci occurrence in the meta-analysis of interest and foci occurrence in the reference set of unselected studies.

**What happened to the "forward inference" and "reverse inference" analysis?**

On Neurosynth.org, we renamed the pre-generated forward and reverse inference maps; they're now referred to as the "uniformity test" and "association test" maps that we discuss here.

Although the method we used hasn't changed (MKDA Chi-Squared), the latter names more accurately capture what these maps actually mean. It was a mistake on our part to have used the forward and reverse inference labels; those labels should properly be reserved for posterior probability maps generated via a Bayesian estimation analysis, rather than for z-scores resulting from a frequentist inferential test of association. Probability maps are more difficult to interpret and use correctly, as they depend on the *prior* assumed by the researcher. Since setting an appropriate prior is highly non-trivial, these maps are disabled by default.

## Specifying MKDA Chi-Squared Meta-Analysis

:::tip
For this example, we'll use the default parameters for the `MKDAChi2` algorithm. 
For in depth documentation on the specific parameters of each algorithm, refer to the NiMARE documentation: [`MKDAChi2`](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/nimare.meta.cbma.mkda.MKDAChi2.html)

Specifying an MKDA Chi-Square meta-analysis in Neurosynth is easy. Simply, select a target set of Analyses to include from your StudySet as you would for any other meta-analysis. 

In Step 3 ("Create Meta-Analysis Specification") of your Project, select *MKDAChi2* as the *algorithm*. 


![MKDA Chi Squared](/tutorial/mkda_chi_squared_algo.png). 

Next, select the annotation inclusion column you want to use, as before (by default, the "included" column will be used).

Now, select a reference dataset from the dropdown list below. The Neurosynth dataset represents the latest release of the legacy *Neurosynth* dataset (version 7), released July, 2018. The *Neurostore* dataset represents the latest update of our continuously updating "live" dataset, spanning over 20,000 neuroimaging studies.

Now simply complete the rest of the meta-analysis specification wizard to finish. 

:::tip
When comparing a manually-curated meta-analysis to a reference dataset there are several potential issues to be aware of. First, the reference dataset is composed of automatically extracted coordinates, while a manual curated dataset has corrected coordinate data. Second, unless you include all relevant studies in your target StudySet, some studies relevant to your question of interest may remain in the reference dataset, modestly biasing results

## Executing your analysis

The *MKDA Chi-Squared* algorithm is more computational expensive than a traditional *MKDA Density* analysis. As a result, it's unlikely to complete with the freely available resources available on Google Colab.

You can run this workflow locally in one line using docker by copying the command your screen. See the *execution* documentation page for more information.

We recommend at least 32GB of RAM to perform a MKDA Chi-Squared analysis

## Interpreting results

The *MKDA Chi-Squared* Workflow outputs two types of maps: **uniformity** and **association** test maps.

- **Uniformity test map:** z-scores from a one-way ANOVA testing whether the proportion of studies that report activation at a given voxel differs from the rate that would be expected if activations were uniformly distributed throughout gray matter.

The uniformity test map can be interpreted in roughly the same way as most standard whole-brain fMRI analysis: it displays the degree to which each voxel is consistently activated in studies that use a given term. For instance, for a meta-analysis of "emotion" high z-scores in the amygdala implies that studies that use the word emotion a lot tend to consistently report activation in the amygdala--at least, more consistently than one would expect if activation were uniformly distributed throughout gray matter. 

- **Association test map**: z-scores from a two-way ANOVA testing for the presence of a non-zero association between term use and voxel activation.

The association test maps tell you whether activation in a region occurs more consistently for studies in your meta-analysis m than for other studies in the reference dataset. In other words, a large positive z-score implies that studies in a meta-analysis are more likely to report XXX activation than studies whose abstracts don't include the word 'emotion'. 

Note that association maps *do not* tell you what the probability of a given psychological concept or task is. High Z-scores do not imply that a certain region or voxel is *selective* for a given concept or task. Instead, it just means there is evidence that there is at least a non-zero difference between reference studies, and studies in the meta-analysis.

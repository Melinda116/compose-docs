# Outline

1. Create Project
2. Select Simple Workflow
3. Import from Neurostore
4. Enter search term
5. Promote all studies to Included
6. Ingest
7. Say all studies are annotated and included
8. Select the MKDA-Chi-squared


# Create Project

As with any meta-analysis on Neurosynth Compose you will need to create a project.

# Simple Workflow

Since you will not be performing any manual curation of the studies, the Simple workflow
is the best choice for this project.
The PRISMA workflow would be overkill for this project as PRISMA involves checking each
individual study for inclusion, which for a large-scale meta-analysis would be very time consuming.

# Import from Neurostore

After selecting the simple workflow, you have several options to import studies.
Importing from neurostore is the simplest way to get started since all the studies selected will have coordinates associated with them.
You will be taken to a search box where you can enter the search term you are interested in, while you are not restricted to the terms in the original neurosynth database,
you are not guaranteed to find enough studies if you enter a term that is
not in the original database.

# Promote studies

In an automated meta-analysis you will not be performing any manual curation of the studies, so you can promote all the studies to included using the respective button.

# Ingest

With all the studies promoted, you can now ingest them as a studyset for use in a meta-analysis.


# Say all studies are annotated and edited

Since you are not performing any manual curation of the studies, you can say that all the studies are annotated and edited

# Select the MKDA-Chi-squared

During the algorithm selection stage choose MKDA-Chi-squared

# Exploratory automated large-scale meta-analysis

Like the original Neurosynth, Neurosynth Compose allows users to perform automated meta-analyses using the Neurosynth database.
Finding the analyses for the concepts you are interested in is easy using the search bar.
You can enter combinations of search terms into the search bar

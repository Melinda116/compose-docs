# Project

### Overview

A project consists of the various components necessary to run a meta-analysis from start to finish.
Within a project you will be able to:
 1. **Curate** studies of interest and select the ones to be included in the meta-analysis 
 2. **Extract** the relevant data such as coordinates and other relevant meta-data
 3. **Specify** the algorithm and corrector you would like to use to run the meta-analysis
 4. **Run** the meta-analysis and **View** the results

You can open a specific project by logging in, navigating to the 
[My Projects](https://compose.neurosynth.org/projects) page, and selecting a project you've created. 
To create a new project, click the <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>New Project</span> button in the top navbar and input the name/description.

When you view a project for the first time, you'll notice that you'll default to the "Edit Project" tab.
The "View Meta-Analyses" tab will be disabled and will become enabled when you have created the first meta-analysis specification 
for the project.

In order to successfully run a meta-analysis, you must sequentially complete the various Project steps as shown on the page.

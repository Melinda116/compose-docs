# Project

A project organizes the the various steps needed to create a meta-analysis from start to finish.

Within a project you will be able to:
 1. **[Curate](./Project/Curation)** studies of interest and select the ones to be included in the meta-analysis 
 2. **[Extract](./Project/Extraction)** the relevant data such as activation coordinates and other meta-data
 3. **[Specify](./Project/Specification)** the algorithm and corrector you would like to use
 4. **Run** the meta-analysis and **View** the results

In each project, you can define a define a single StudySe (i.e. a collection of related studies), and one or more MetaAnalysis specifications.


You can open a specific project by logging in, navigating to the 
[My Projects](https://compose.neurosynth.org/projects) page, and selecting a project you've created. 

When you view a project for the first time, you'll notice that you'll default to the "Edit Project" tab.
The "View Meta-Analyses" tab will be disabled and will become enabled when you have created the first meta-analysis specification 
for the project.

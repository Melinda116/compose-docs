# Explore

Here, you can browse and search existing public `Studies`, `StudySets` and `Meta-Analyses` created on the platform. 

## Studies

The `Studies` page lets you browse and search all studies that exist on the NeuroStore server. This interface is similar to what you'll see when importing studies into your `Project`. However, here it's simply provided for your browsing pleasure. 

For more information on how advanced search functionally, see [Searching Studies](./Explore/Searching)

## StudySets and Meta-Analyses

For `StudySets` and `Meta-Analyses`, you can browse and search any user-contributed items, including those from other users. 

Note that although you see all publically available items, you cannot edit somebody else's content. 

:::note
We are currently working on a way to allow users to fork other users' `StudySets` and `Meta-Analyses` to create their own versions.
Stay tuned!

# What is Neurosynth Compose?

*Neurosynth Compose* is the next-generation of Neurosynth, enabling users to easily perform custom neuroimaging meta-analyses using a fully web-based platform, with no programming experience required. 

*Neurosynth Compose* is *free to use* and helps users:

* 🔎 **Search** across over 15,000 studies in the Neurosynth database, or import more from PubMed, or any bibliographic database.
* 🗃️ **Curate** your meta-analysis using systematic review tools conforming to the [PRISMA](https://www.prisma-statement.org/) guidelines.
* 📝 **Extract** accurate coordinates and metadata for each study, leveraging the Neurosynth database to minimize manual effort.
* 📊 **Analyze** your meta-analysis by specfying a reproducible [NiMARE](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nimare/) workflow, and execute it locally or in the cloud. 
* 🔗 **Share** your meta-analysis with the community with complete provenance and reproducibility.

# Frequently Asked Questions

* How does this project relate to the original Neurosynth?
  
Neurosynth 1.0 was an online platform for browsing automatically generated large-scale neuroimaging meta-analyses. However, because all analyses were pre-generated, users were unable to define custom meta-analyses using the Neurosynth database. Instead, Neurosynth 1.0 used text mining techniques to automatically group studies based on the frequency of the terms mentioned in the text. Neurosynth Compose is focused on allowing users to overcome the limitations of automated large-scale meta-analysis, by enabling users to annotate studies, and curate sets of studies amenable for meta-analysis. This way, users can systematically define meta-analyses using their own expertise, while still leveraging the Neurosynth database, and an easy-to-use web-based analysis builder to accelerate the meta-analysis process.
